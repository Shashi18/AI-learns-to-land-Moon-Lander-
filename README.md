# AI-learns-to-land-Moon-Lander-
In this project, I have implemented Genetic Algorithm to let the agent learn to land a Moon Lander at a specific co-ordinate relayed to it.

I have used a population of 70 and a deep learning approach. Here, we have two hidden layers with 40 neurons each on an average. 
You can use your own as well.

Crossover: Single Crossover/ Uniform Crossover seems to work quite well.

Elitism fails for this project. Hence, I moved ahead wtih a random set of parents between 10 to 40 to next generation to keep a healthy 
variation.
